## These are some queries to show visual comparisons of the grid before and after your progress

### Alldata query
This query gives you a layer with all of the power infrastructure the team/you have mapped. 
⚠️For better visualisaton, run the starter kit query to find all infrastructure, then run the "alldata" query. Have the alldata query activated and the bottom layer with all other infrastructure on visible. You can change the colour of the bottom layer in Edit>Preferences>Colours>Inactive, to a bright colour to see the contrast well.
