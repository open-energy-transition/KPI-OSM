# Steps
1. Run query in JOSM
2. Select all -> in the Tags Window (on the right), right click on the "plant=output=electricity" **value**, and copy value
3. Run python script, paste values and press enter


## Issues
1. When two power plants are part of one multipolygon (ex: Ezra power plants in South sudan), it only counts as one in the tag value.
