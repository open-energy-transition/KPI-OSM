# KPI-OSM
These are some queries and code to determine teams KPI's in OSM.

## 🔄 Before and after script
This script gives you a good visualisation of the mapping activities users have made. 
It includes two queries: the first query fetches all mapping activity since a specific date, and the second fetches all activity by usernames.

❗If you use the query based on a date, someone else might have mapped in-between and thus that activity will also be fetched.
